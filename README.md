my recipe for biriyani

Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or frying pan. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chicken pieces and let them cook, undisturbed, for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.


Turn the chicken pieces and add the onion, jalapeno, ginger, salt, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Saute for 3 minutes, or until the onions have softened.


Add the garlic, tomatoes, and raisins to the pan. Stir well, then add the rice and broth. Allow the liquid to come to a boil, then cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low. 

Let the rice steam for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. Re-cover the pan, and allow the rice to continue to steam for another 10 minutes.
Garnish with cilantro leaves and almond slices. Serve the Biryani straight out of the pan, accompanied by lime wedges for squeezing.
